home - homeSingle image is pretty small, and footer font is a bit big. responsiveness is great.
about - aboutMain is a bit small/mismatched in size, but otherwise it looks really good.
menu - phenomenal. no notes really. especially love the responsiveness.
catering - great responsiveness on the page. Would really love it if the image to the left of the text box matched in height, but aside from that solid work.
photos- photos are 3 columns 4 rows, instead of 4 columns 3 rows. Otherwise, looks nice.
